	<h1>  Time, Space, Complexity </h1>

<p> Time complexity The space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though.  The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.
 It is the time needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the time complexity, we need to consider the cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed. </p>

<p> <b> Space Complexity</b> The term Space Complexity is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space and Space Complexity. 

Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
The space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though. </p>
